# pypiano
Piano in Python! &lt;WINDOWS ONLY>

This uses winsound and msvcrt which is only available in Windows. So this program doesn't work in other OS, like Mac or Linux.
Or do you want a piano with no keys and sounds?

***
## How to Play?
Run piano.py on your comand prompt. Python should be version 3.
I'm not sure this works with Python 2.

Push keyboard button to play(ENTER KEY IS NOT NEEDED)
o to show license.
p to exit.
Oher keys do nothing.
